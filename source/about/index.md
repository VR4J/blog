<p style="text-align: justify;">
You've found me, my name is <a class="linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joery-vreijsen">Joery Vreijsen</a>; software artisan, craftsman, or whatever other fancy title is used nowadays. 

Usually you find me cracking my head around side-projects build in Java or <a class="kotlin" href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>. Now and then I try to do some front-end development but that never really ends well.

Apart from spending my time giving in to my Monster Energy addiction, I develop beautiful software for <a class="kabisa" href="https://kabisa.nl">Kabisa</a>, a Software Company in The Netherlands. 

When i'm not doing any of the above, i'm probably hanging around, enjoying the roaring engines of some <a class="formula-one" href="https://f1.com">Formula 1</a> venue.

Still don't know enough? Sheer not, and <a class="blog" href="/contact">contact me</a> now!
